## **Frontend Technologies** 🖥️

1. **React** ⚛️
   - **Why**: React enables fast, dynamic, and scalable front-end development. We use it for building our Single Page Applications (SPAs).
   - **Additional Libraries**:
     - **Redux** 🔄: For state management.
     - **Material-UI** 🎨: A component library for building responsive and styled UI elements.
     - **React Router** 🚦: For routing and navigation within the application.
2. **Vite** ⚡
   - **Why**: Vite is used for fast development builds and optimized bundling.

3. **TypeScript** 🔤
   - **Why**: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors in the codebase, improving the development experience and product quality.

On Plan:
**Next.js** 📦
   - **Why**: Using Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which improves SEO and user experience.

## **Backend Technologies** 🌐

1. **ASP.NET Core** ⚙️
   - **Why**: We use ASP.NET Core for high-performance, cross-platform backend services. It’s well-suited for enterprise-grade applications.

2. **Docker** 🐋
   - **Why**: Containerization with Docker ensures that our applications are portable, isolated, and easy to deploy across environments.

On Plan:
**GraphQL** 🔍
   - **Why**: For flexible and optimized data fetching, we use GraphQL, allowing us to request only the data needed.

**Redis** 🔴
   - **Why**: Redis is our go-to solution for caching and fast data retrieval.

## **Database Technologies** 💾

1. **PostgreSQL** 🗄️
   - **Why**: A powerful, open-source relational database system we use to store structured data with ACID compliance.

On Plan: 
**MongoDB** 🐒
   - **Why**: For document-based storage, we use MongoDB, especially for handling unstructured data.

---

## **DevOps and Infrastructure** 🔧

1. **Docker Compose** 🔀
   - **Why**: We use Docker Compose to manage multi-container Docker applications, ensuring consistency across environments.
     
2. **CI/CD** 🚀
   - **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment pipelines.

4. **Cloud Infrastructure** ☁️
   - **Why**: We utilize cloud infrastructure for best user expierience

---

## **Testing & Quality Assurance** ✅

1. **Cypress** 🧪
   - **Why**: For end-to-end testing of our web applications.

3. **ESLint** 🧐
   - **Why**: We use ESLint to enforce coding standards and catch errors early in the development process.

4. **Prettier** ✨
   - **Why**: For consistent code formatting across our codebase.

On Plan:
**Jest** 🧑‍💻
   - **Why**: For unit and integration testing in our JavaScript/TypeScript codebases.

---

## **Security Tools** 🔐
One Plan:
**OWASP ZAP** 🕵️‍♂️
   - **Why**: For security scanning of our web applications to identify vulnerabilities.

**SonarQube** 🧩
   - **Why**: To ensure that our code is secure, maintainable, and high-quality by identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

---

## **Project Management Tools** 📋

1. **Jira** 📊
   - **Why**: We use Jira for tracking tasks


---

## **Monitoring & Logging** 📈

To choose:
**Prometheus** 📊
   - **Why**: For real-time monitoring of services and infrastructure metrics.

**Grafana** 📉
   - **Why**: For visualizing and analyzing logs and metrics.

**Loggly** 📜
   - **Why**: For centralized logging and monitoring, allowing us to catch issues in real-time.

---

## **External Integrations** 🔗

1. **Brevo** 📧
   - **Why**: For email communications, including marketing and transactional emails, and SMS.

3. **QuestPDF** 📱
